# Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators

- inside the computer, there is only data
- Bits: any kind of two-valued things, usually 0 and 1
- Any piece of discrete<sup>[1](#nf1)</sup> information can be reduced to a sequence of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits.

<a name="fn1">1</a>: Here is a link to the definition of [discrete](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discrete).

- In JavaScript, chunks of information are called values.

This chapter is about the 'atomic' elements of JavaScript

## Numbers

13 is 001101 in binary. Using 13 in JavaScript causes the bit pattern for 13 to come into existence in the computer's memory.

JavaScript uses 64 bits to store a single number value.

"The important thing is to be aware of it and treat fractional digital numbers as approximations, not as precise values."
