>"A few giant corporations have been imposing their control over most of the world's computers and deciding what you can and cannot do with them. Fortunately, people from all over the world are doing something about it. They are fighting to maintain control of their computers by writing their own software. They are building Linux." - William Shotts, The Linux Command Line

The command line is the shell. The shell is a program that takes input from the keyboard and passes it to the os to carry out.
