# Introducing Props

## Setting and Using Props

props - a list of properties used to pass data to a component. Components are customized and made reusable with props.

I have been using props ineffeciently. `props` is an object that is automatically associated with a component.

## Components and Props

## Iterating and Rendering with map()

- map()

Resources

- [map() – MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)

Notes: "map calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, in order, and constructs a new array from the results."
