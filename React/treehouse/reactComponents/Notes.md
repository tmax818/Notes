# Managing State and Data Flow

Itâ€™s important to think carefully about where state resides in your application. In this stage, you will restructure state and data flow to be more unidirectional.

## Unidirectional Data Flow

## Lifting State Up

## Commmunicating Between Components

## Update State Based on a Player's Index

## Building the Statistics Component

## Controlled Components

## Adding Items to State

## Updating the Players State Based on Previous State

```JavaScript
handleAddPlayer = (name) => {
    this.setState( prevState => {
        return {
            players: [
                ...prevState.players,
                {
                    name,
                    score: 0,
                    id: this.prevPlayerId += 1
                }
            ]
        }
    })
}
```

Alternative using `concat() method:

```JavaScript
handleAddPlayer = (name) => {
  let newPlayer = {
    name,
    score: 0,
    id: this.prevPlayerId += 1
  };
  this.setState( prevState => ({
    players: prevState.players.concat(newPlayer)
  }));
}
```

## Managing State Review

Which of the following best describes unidirectional data flow?

# Stateful Components and Lifecycle Methods

This stage covers working with React component lifecycle methods. You will also learn to use conditional rendering to update your UI based on the current state.

## Designing the Stopwatch

- Oh shit!!

## Stopwatch State

## Update the Stopwatch State with componentDidMount()

## Resetting the Stopwatch

## Prevent Memory Leaks with componentWillUnmount()

# React Component Patters

Learn useful design patterns to use in your React components. These patterns will not only help prevent you from writing messy and over-complicated code, but also help you create flexible, more performant components that are easier to understand and maintain.
