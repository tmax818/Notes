This is the random draft file. My intention is to use this file to write thoughts that will later be compiled into other files for better organization.

The organization of knowledge is key to the retention of knowledge. This is a quote from the Plural-site Outlier course;

> The point is, justifying your logic will both clarify, and solidify your knowledge. It will shine a spotlight on the areas that you thought you understood, and force you to fill in the gaps. Keep in mind that you don't have to teach someone in person to benefit from this step. Writing a blog post, and explaining it to your cat, or posting some new piece of software to Git Hub in hopes of receiving feedback, all of these sorts of activities will help you teach someone else. This act of organizing and justifying your thoughts is the important part for increasing both your attention, and your comprehension. So, this brings us to the magical three-step process for becoming an expert at anything. You need to watch someone, try it yourself and experiment, and then go teach someone else.

So this is the statement of purpose: the why of this writing. It seems that starting is the hard part. I set out to write everything I know and I stare at a blinking cursor. This is what I have learned. It seems that I have a basic understanding of many things. I must confess that to this point, I lack depth in any one area. My degree is in philosophy, and I would have to say that my understanding of the topic is cursory at best. What I am doing now is the solution I have come to. Writing to learn. Another book that I have started to read.

We all know what to do. The secret to success is hidden in plain sight. Part of the solution is brutal honesty with one's self. I want to be an Outlier. I want to stand out. That's not going to happen unless I move my feet. I guess move my fingers in this instance. There is no shame on standing on the shoulders of giants. It's seems to be the way it works.

It seems that the amount I don't know is staggering. How do I correct this? I think 'this' is how! I was unclear on the difference between a interpreter and a compiler. I found the above image [here](https://www.programiz.com/article/difference-compiler-interpreter). I knew the answer. I remember the anaology in the Teaching Company course about the courtroom interpreter and a translated novel.

What about a spiritual leader who writes her own bible?
